# Informal description
EZWallet (read EaSy Wallet) is a software application designed to help individuals and families keep track of their expenses. Users can enter and categorize their expenses, allowing them to quickly see where their money is going. EZWallet is a powerful tool for those looking to take control of their finances and make informed decisions about their spending.


# Business model
This application is being developed as an open-source project. The project aims to become a self-hosted solution for users who want to manage their expenses without relying on any commercial product that may be more at risk of potential data leaks or, without the user knowing, may sell their information online. 

The community behind the project is composed of developers that work on the application in their free time. The owners of the repository on gitlab are the project leaders that guide the other developers towards predefined goals during the development phase. To support them a small bank account has been setted up to accept donations by users.

The user who sets up the service on the server has elevated privileges and can modify transactions, categories and user accounts' informations in order to intervene in case problems arise. Users can access the service through their browser to register or login and start tracking their expenses, eventually inside a group composed of other individuals. 

The system allows users to link the application to their bank account, in order to recover previous transaction informations, without having the need to input them manually.

# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |

|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other normal executions> |
|  Exceptions     | \<exceptions, errors > |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>
