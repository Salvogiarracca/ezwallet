# Project Estimation - CURRENT
Date: 28-04-2023

Version: 1.1.2


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: |
| NC =  Estimated number of modules to be developed                                                         |8|          
| A = Estimated average size per module, in LOC                                                             |163| 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                          |1300| 
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                      |130|   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                       |3900| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week )   | 1 |               

### Modules: documents, app, controllers, db, models, routes, server, test.
### We have included on the calculation *.js files LOCs + *V1.md files LOCs

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: | :---------------:|
| estimate by size | 130 person hours | 4 days |
| estimate by product decomposition | 328 person hours | 10 days |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 536 person hours | 17 days |

The calculations performed are based on the code given to us. In the estimation by LOCs we have considered only the *.js files and the *V1.md documents: it is based solely on the numbers of lines of code, without taking into account other factors such as the number of features, the complexity of the code and the skill level of the developement team. This approach assumes that the amount of effort required to complete a project is directly proportional to the LOCs, which means that may not be always accurate. We have assumed that external libraries are not to be included to the calculations and there are no acquisition costs for them. On the other hand, the estimation by Product/Activity break down the project into smaller and manageable tasks and estimate the effort required to complete each one. They consider a wider range of factors that can affect the project's complexity and duration, indeed those two approaches are generally more accurate compared to the first one.

Assumptions: in all the estimation approaches, we have team of 4 people that works 8 hours per day, 5 days per week.
