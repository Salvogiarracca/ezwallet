Version: 1


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| NC =  Estimated number of modules to be developed                                                         |4?|          
| A = Estimated average size per module, in LOC                                                             |130| 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                          |520| 
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                      |52|   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                       |1560| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week )   |0.32|               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document    | 320 |
| GUI prototype | 240 |
|design document | 480 |
|code | 20000 |
| unit tests | 1000 |
| api tests | 400 |
| management documents  | 80 |



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
