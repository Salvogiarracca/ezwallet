# Project Estimation - FUTURE
Date: 28-04-2023

Version: 1.0.5


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by the team), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: |
| NC =  Estimated number of modules to be developed                                                         |8|          
| A = Estimated average size per module, in LOC                                                             |8400| 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                          |16800| 
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                      |1680|   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                       |54400| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week )   | 11 |               
### Modules: documents, app, controllers, db, models, routes, server, test.

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: | :---------------: |
| estimate by size | 1680 person hours | 55 days |
| estimate by product decomposition | 1896 person hours | 62 days |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 5960 person hours | 190 days |

TODO ASAP

Assumptions: in all the estimation approaches, we have team of 4 people that works 8 hours per day, 5 days per week.
