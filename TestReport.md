# Integration approach
    
    Bottom-up integration: In this approach, integration starts with the lowest-level modules and progresses upward. The dependent modules are integrated first, followed by the main modules that depend on them. The sequence can be defined as:
    
    Step 1: Unit testing of lower-level functions (Auth.js and Utils.js) and lowest-level modules (models.js and User.js). WB/ statement coverage technique is used to define the test cases, covering all the possible statements.
    Step 2: Unit testing of higher-level functions (controller.js, users.js, and genericFunctions.js). WB/ statement coverage technique is used to define the test cases, covering all the possible statements.
    Step 3: Integration testing of the lower-level modules (models.js and User.js) and higher-level functions (controller.js, users.js, and genericFunctions.js). 
    Step 4: API testing of the routes.js file, verifying the correct interaction between the endpoints, functions, and modules.
    Step 5: System testing of the application, verifying the correct interaction between the endpoints, functions, database, and modules.
